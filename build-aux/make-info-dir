### Commentary:

## Generate info/dir, for systems without install-info.
## Expects to be called from top-level Emacs source directory.

## It only handles the case where info/dir is missing from the
## installation directory.  It does not handle info/dir being present
## but missing some entries.

### Code:

if test $# -ne 1; then
    echo "Specify destination file"
    exit 1
fi

outfile=$1

echo "Creating $outfile..."

if test -f "$outfile"; then
    echo "$outfile already present"
    exit 1
fi

## Header contains non-printing characters, so this is more
## reliable than using echo.
basefile=build-aux/dir_top

if test ! -f "$basefile"; then
    echo "$basefile not found"
    exit 1
fi


cp $basefile $outfile


## FIXME inefficient looping.
